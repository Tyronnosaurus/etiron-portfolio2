                     <p>The entry is a webapp where you can upload annual reports of companies and extract summaries of the differences between two reports, for any subject
                     (e.g. how performance in Europe changed for different years of a particular company, or between two companies).
                     It also includes a tool to calculate custom KPIs even if they don't explicitely appear in the reports.</p>
                     <p>The backend uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to locate the pages with the most relevant information and prompt OpenAI with the necessary context to solve the query. To calculate custom KPIs, the app first queries OpenAI for the adequate formula and then attempts to find its operands within the document.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the website has responsiveness, user registration, file upload, a paid tier, payment processor, a chat with response streaming in real time and infinite scrolling, etc.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The axes had mechanical differences which meant the homing and anti-collision systems had to be rewritten.</li>   
                <li>The mold axis incorporated a toggle mechanism, which required a CAM control in order to have a lineal mold movement.</li>
                <li>New external sensors meant I had to write a new data adquisition program. It plotted internal pressure and temperature for the last injection cycles (among other data) and proved very useful to increase repetibility.</li>

        <p>After installing a pressure sensor at the piston, I developed the PI controller shown.</p>
        <p>The implementation was particularly tricky as the plastic being pushed was continuously melting and flowing into the mold cavities.
